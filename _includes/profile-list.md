{{ include.whitespace }}- **Monitored Storage Server:** A monitored storage profile is a good option to use for server nodes that are already part of an existing filesystem. Instead of attempting to manage the server nodes, using a monitor profile will simply monitor the storage server and provide metrics for the filesystem operations on the dashboard page.
{{ include.whitespace }}- **Managed Storage Server:** This allows the manager GUI to configure Corosync and Pacemaker, configure NTP, etc., so that the manager software can monitor and manage the server. Managed storage servers must be physically configured for high-availability/server failover.
{{ include.whitespace }}- **POSIX HSM Agent Node:** An HSM Agent node is used in hierarchical storage management to run an instance of Copytool. Copytool transfers certain files between the Lustre file system and the archive. Archived files are deleted from the Lustre file system.

{{ include.whitespace }}- **Robinhood Policy Engine Server:** This server hosts the Robinhood policy engine, which enables automation of hierarchical storage management activities. See [Configuring and using Hierarchical Storage Management]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Config_and_using_HSM_6_0.md %}).
