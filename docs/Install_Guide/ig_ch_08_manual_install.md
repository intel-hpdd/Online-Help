[**Software Installation Guide Table of Contents**](ig_TOC.md)

Some installations may opt to deploy and configure a Lustre file system
manually, without Integrated Manager for Lustre software. Other
installations may opt to deploy and configure a Lustre file system and
then later install Integrated Manager for Lustre software to be used in
Monitor-only mode.

For information regarding installing and configuring Lustre, see Part II
of the Lustre Operations Manual. This is available at the following URL.
