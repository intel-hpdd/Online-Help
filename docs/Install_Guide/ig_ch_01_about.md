## Document Purpose

This document provides detailed instructions for installing Integrated Manager for Lustre\* software. This document:

* Introduces Integrated Manager for Lustre\* software and its capabilities

* Introduces Integrated Manager for Lustre* software and its
  capabilities to configure and support real-time management of
  Lustre* file systems, using a GUI-based dashboard

* Provides detailed instructions about how to configure the components
  to create a file system that meets the High Availability
  Configuration Specification (discussed herein). Conformance with
  this specification permits configuration, monitoring, and
  management of the Lustre* file system using the Integrated Manager for Lustre* software.

* Describes the pre-installation tasks such as configuring servers,
  establishing yum repositories, configuring LNET, and also
  discusses Linux\* kernel considerations

* Describes how to install Integrated Manager for Lustre\* software

* Describes how to configure Integrated Manager for Lustre\* software

* Describes how to add storage servers to the Lustre\* file system

* Provides troubleshooting information

## Intended Audience

This guide is intended for partners who are designing storage solutions
based on Integrated Manager for Lustre\* software. Readers are
assumed to be full-time Linux system administrators or equivalent who
have:

* experience administering file systems and are familiar with storage
  components such as block storage, SAN, and LVM

* Proficiency in setting up, administering and maintaining networks.
  Knowledge of LNET is required. Knowledge of InfiniBand\* is required
  if InfiniBand is to be used.

* Detailed knowledge of the overall configuration of the storage
  system and the ability to verify that the configuration matches the
  configuration requirements as defined in this guide.

This document is _not intended for end users_ of storage solutions
implemented using the Integrated Manager for Lustre\* software.
