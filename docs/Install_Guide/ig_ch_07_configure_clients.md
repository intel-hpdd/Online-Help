# Configuring Clients

**In this Chapter:**

- [Client Requirements](#client-requirements)
- [Installing Integrated Manager for Lustre software on Clients Running RHEL or CentOS](#installing-manager-for-lustre-software-on-clients-running-rhel-or-centos)

A client (compute node) accessing a storage appliance must be running
Integrated Manager for Lustre software {{site.version}} client software. The Lustre file system
must first be created or discovered at the Integrated Manager for Lustre software
dashboard (see the Integrated Manager for Lustre software Online Help to do this).
The Lustre client software must be installed on the client, and then the
Lustre file system can be mounted on the client as described in the
Online Help.

## Client Requirements

Each file system client must be running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
or CentOS Linux, version {{site.centos_version}}.

**Notes**:

- Before using the Red Hat or RHEL software referenced herein, please refer to Red Hatâ€™s website for more information, including without limitation, information regarding the mitigation of potential security vulnerabilities in the Red Hat software.

LNET provides the client network infrastructure required by the Lustre
file system and LNET must be configured for each client. See [LNET Configuration](ig_ch_04_pre_install.md/#lnet-configuration).

## Installing Integrated Manager for Lustre software on Clients Running RHEL or CentOS

To configure a Lustre client running RHEL or CentOS version {{site.centos_version}},
perform these steps:

1. For clients running RHEL or CentOS version {{site.centos_version}}, add a client
   repository with the following command.

   ```bash
   yum-config-manager --add-repo https://downloads.whamcloud.com/public/lustre/lustre-{{site.lustre_version}}/el7/client/
   ```

1. Install the required Lustre packages on each client:

   a. Enter (on one line):

   ```bash
   yum install lustre-client
   ```

   b. Update the bootloader (grub.conf or lilo.conf) configuration file as
   needed.

   **Note**: Verify that the bootloader configuration file has been updated with an entry for the new kernel. Before you can boot to a kernel, an entry for it must be included in the bootloader configuration file. Often it is added automatically when the kernel RPM is installed.

1. Launch Integrated Manager for Lustre software and login as
   administrator. Go to the manager GUI to obtain mount point
   information:

   a. Go to **Configuration > File Systems.**

   b. In the table listing available file systems, click the name of the
   file system to be accessed by the client. A page showing file system
   details will be displayed.

   c. Click **View Client Mount Information**. The mount command to be
   used to mount the file system will be displayed as shown in this
   _example_:

   ```bash
   mount -t lustre 10.214.13.245@tcp0:/test /mnt/test
   ```

1. On the client, enter the mount command provided.
