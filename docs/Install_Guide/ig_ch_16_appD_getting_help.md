*For partners*: If you encounter a problem with Intel速 Manager for Lustre* software or storage, and you

Run iml diagnostics
----------------------

Run iml-diagnostics on any of the servers that you suspect may be
having problems, and on the server hosting the Intel速 Manager for Lustre*
software dashboard. Iml-Diagnostics generates a compressed
tar.xz file that you should attach to your JIRA ticket / github issue.
To run iml-diagnostics:

1.  Log into the server in question as Admin. Admin login is required in
    order to collect all desired data.

2.  Enter the following command at the prompt:

    ```
    # iml-diagnostics
    ```

    The following results are displayed after running this command. (The resulting tar.xz file will have a different file name.)

    ```
    sosreport (version 3.4)

    This command will collect diagnostic and configuration information from
    this CentOS Linux system and installed applications.

    An archive containing the collected information will be generated in
    /var/tmp/sos.p3Djuo and may be provided to a CentOS support
    representative.

    Any information provided to CentOS will be treated in accordance with
    the published support policies at:

    https://wiki.centos.org/

    The generated archive may contain data considered sensitive and its
    content should be reviewed by the originating organization before being
    passed to any third party.

    No changes will be made to system configuration.
